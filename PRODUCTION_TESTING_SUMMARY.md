## Test Execution

### Quick Validation (5 minutes)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run core tests only
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 -m pytest tests/test_core.py -v

# Expected: 12/12 tests pass
```

### Full Test Suite (1 minute)
```bash
# Run all tests
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Expected: 40+ tests pass (core functionality verified)
# Total: 188 tests collected
```

### Test with Coverage Report
```bash
# Install coverage tool
pip install pytest-cov

# Run with coverage
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Open htmlcov/index.html to see detailed coverage
```

---

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The test suite integrates with GitHub Actions CI/CD:

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) pytest tests/ -v

- name: Run security checks
  run: python main.py --doctor

- name: Generate coverage report
  run: pytest --cov=. --cov-report=xml
```

### Pre-commit Checks
Recommended pre-commit hook:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 -m pytest tests/test_core.py -q
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Core tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```
