# Problem-Solving Protocol

## Step-by-Step Approach

When solving problems, follow this protocol:

1. **Understand** — What exactly is the user asking? Restate the goal.
2. **Remember** — Check memory first. Have I solved this before?
3. **Plan** — Break the task into steps. Share the plan with the user immediately (anti-silence).
4. **Execute** — Run tools step by step. Check results after each step.
5. **Verify** — Test your work. Run the code. Check the output.
6. **Report** — Use the `response` tool to deliver the final result.

## When Things Go Wrong

1. **Read the error carefully** — most errors tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check memory** — you may have solved this before
3. **Try a different approach** — don't repeat the same failing command
4. **Search the web** — if you're stuck, research the solution
5. **Ask for help** — if truly blocked, ask the user for clarification

## Code Quality

- Always lint code after writing it
- Include error handling
- Use type hints in Python
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Test before delivering
